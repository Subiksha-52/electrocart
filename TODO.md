# Git Commit and Push TODO

## Objective
Resolve Git issues by safely committing root changes (README.md and updated .gitignore), ignoring sensitive files, and pushing to origin/main. Backend is already pushed; focus on root/frontend sync.

## Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Update .gitignore to add ignores for sensitive untracked files (download, pin, *.pub).
- [ ] Step 2: Verify git status to confirm changes.
- [ ] Step 3: Stage the updated .gitignore and README.md.
- [ ] Step 4: Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
- [ ] Step 5: Push to origin/main.
- [ ] Step 6: Final verification and update this TODO.md to mark completion.

## Notes
- Do not commit sensitive files (e.g., *.pub likely SSH keys).
- If any errors occur (e.g., auth issues), stop and notify.
- After completion, the repository should be up to date with all safe changes pushed.
